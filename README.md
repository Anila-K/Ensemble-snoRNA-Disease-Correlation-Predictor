# Ensemble-snoRNA-Disease-Correlation-Predictor
This repository houses the implementation of an ensemble model designed to predict snoRNA-disease associations. The model combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) to improve the accuracy and efficiency of disease prediction tasks.\

The study utilizes the MNDR v3.1 dataset, which encompasses 27 diseases, 220 snoRNAs, and 459 known associations. The project is developed in Python, leveraging libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Keras, and Matplotlib. The model demonstrates high performance, achieving an AUC score of 0.9591 through 5-fold cross-validation.
